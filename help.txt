== Introduction

Thank you for using AnkiDroid, the Android client for the popular 
http://ankisrs.net/[Anki] spaced repetition system. 

AnkiDroid is currently intended to be used in conjunction with Anki on your computer. 
While it is possible to download shared decks and study without using the desktop 
version at all, card layout editing and many advanced operations can only be done
 on a computer. While this is expected to change over time, for now please ensure you
 have access to a computer in order to perform some of the operations mentioned below.
 
It is *strongly recommended* to at least read http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#the-basics[The Basics section of the main Anki manual] to understand the terminology used here.

== Help & Bugs

Please see the link:help.html[Help] page for how to get help with an issue, or report a bug.

== Changes

For information on recent changes, please see the https://ankidroid.org/docs/changelog.html[changelog].

[[gettingStarted]]
== Getting started
To start using AnkiDroid, we need to add some cards to study. From the main screen, we can either
download card decks that other people have shared, create new empty decks directly from AnkiDroid, 
or add existing decks from the computer.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2G-k2hQyg[This introductory video] shows the basics of studying using a shared deck in the desktop version of Anki, 
which is essentially the same as in AnkiDroid. AnkiDroid specific information which is not in the video is given below.

If you are an existing user of Anki Desktop wishing to import your decks from the computer, 
please jump directly to the <<AnkiDesktop, using AnkiDroid with Anki Desktop>> section. Other users may like
to start by trying out some shared decks:

=== Shared Decks

To download a shared deck directly to your mobile device:

 . Ensure you're connected to the internet.
 . Tap the + button at the top of the screen.
 . Choose *Get shared decks*. AnkiWeb will open.
 . Select a category, or type in a search.
 . Tap *Info* on a deck you'd like to study.
 . Scroll down and tap *Download*.
 . You browser will download the file and display a "download complete" notification. 
 Tap this button.
 . AnkiDroid will appear, and show a confirmation dialog. Tap the *Add* button.
 . When the import completes, your deck should be ready to study.

You can start studying the shared deck by tapping on it, and then pressing the "study" button, 
as discussed in more detail in the video above and the <<reviewer, studying section>> below.

=== New Decks
To add new flashcards directly from AnkiDroid:

 . Tap the Add button in the Action Bar at the top
 . Choose "Create deck"
 . Choose a name for the deck, for example "New Japanese"
 . Tap on the newly created deck to open it
 . You can now add new cards to the deck by tapping the Add button in the Action bar again
 
See the <<addingNotes,adding notes>> section below for detailed information on adding new cards to a deck.

[[deckPicker]]
== The Deck List
*_Note:_* _This section onwards assumes you understand what http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#the-basics[decks and cards] are_

The deck list is the screen you see when you start AnkiDroid. It displays a 
list of your card decks, and allows you to perform various actions:

++++++++++
<img src="img/1-decks.png">
++++++++++

=== Action Bar
At the top of each screen in AnkiDroid is the Action Bar, with buttons for performing various actions. 
The following actions are available from the action bar in the deck list:

AnkiDroid Icon :: Tapping the app icon on the left will show the <<drawer,navigation drawer>> for quickly navigating between the main parts of the app.

Add button :: The + button is used for adding new content to AnkiDroid. You can either <<addingNotes,add a new note>> or deck to create your own flashcards, 
or you can download shared card decks that other people have shared, as per the <<gettingStarted, getting started section>>.

Sync button :: The circular button with arrows on the right is for synchronizing your cards with the cloud, as described in the 
<<AnkiDesktop,adding decks from cloud>> section.

**Hint:** long tapping on a button in the action bar will display a hint describing what the 
button does!

=== Studying a Deck
To study cards in a deck, simply tap on the deck, then tap the *Study* button and AnkiDroid will switch to study mode.

=== Other Deck Actions
Long tapping on a deck will show a list of other actions available to perform on that deck:

Show / Hide subdecks :: It's possible to store subdecks inside your top level decks, and you can use this option to show or hide them. See the 
http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#decks[Anki Desktop manual] for more info on how to use subdecks. 
This will not have any effect if there are no subdecks.

Rename deck :: Use this option to rename a deck

Delete :: Use this option to delete a deck (note: this action is not reversible, although you can <<backups,restore from a backup>>)

Deck options :: Tapping on deck options allows you to configure various deck specific study options.
Please see the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#deckoptions[desktop documentation] for more information about these study options.

Export :: This option can be used to share a deck with other users. See the <<exporting, exporting decks>> section for more information.

=== Advanced Actions
Some additional actions are located in the menu for less common tasks such as options for fixing or restoring your collection from backup if it gets corrupted. 
These are discussed elsewhere in the manual.

=== Deck Counts
You will notice that next to each deck, three numbers are displayed. The left, blue number, corresponds to how 
many new cards you have to learn today. Anki will introduce 20 new cards a day by default, 
and you can customize this number if you'd like. The red number in the middle is for the cards 
due to be studied today which are currently in the learning phase, and the green number is the 
cards which are due for review (i.e. cards which have already graduated from the learning phase). On a deck 
you've never studied before, these numbers will both be zero.

 
[[drawer]]
== Navigation Drawer
++++++++++
<img src="img/2-navigation_drawer.png">
++++++++++

The navigation drawer can be opened from most places in the application by pressing the app icon, 
or alternatively swiping outwards from anywhere on the far left side of the screen. It is used
for quickly navigating between different parts of the application. You can switch to the following screens:

Decks :: Takes you to the top level of the app where the list of cards are shown (<<deckPicker,more info here>>)
Card Browser :: Shows a list of all your cards (<<browser,more info here>>)
Statistics :: Helps you track your study progress (http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#statistics[more info in Anki manual])
Settings :: Allows you to customize the app (<<settings,more info here>>)
Help :: Opens this web page
Send feedback :: Get support from the AnkiDroid team

[[deckOverview]]
== Deck Overview Screen
++++++++++
<img src="img/3-deck_overview.png">
++++++++++
When you tap on a deck in the deck list, the study options screen for that deck will load. From here you can 
study the deck, add new cards, change deck study options, and build custom study decks. If you wish to change to a different deck, 
you can do so by tapping the hardware back button to go back to the decks screen, or you can use the navigation drawer.

Add :: Tap the + button to add new cards to the deck as per the <<addingNotes,adding notes section>>

Night Mode :: The button with the moon and stars allows you to change to night mode in the reviewer, which will change your cards to use a black background.

Deck Options :: Allows you to configure some options related to the current 
deck, such as the number of new cards and reviews to introduce each day.
Please see the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#deckoptions[desktop documentation] for more information about these study options.

Custom Study :: Allows you to do extra reviews outside your normal schedule, or study only certain cards inside a deck. 
See the <<filtered,filtered deck section>> for more information on this.

[[reviewer]]
== Study Screen
Tapping the *study* button from the study options screen will take you to the study screen where you do your study. 
++++++++++
<img src="img/4-reviewer.png">
++++++++++

=== Basics
If you have not used Anki on a computer before, you may like to have a look at the
first http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#_intro_videos[intro video]
before reading on, as it explains the basic review process.

On the top left of the screen you'll see three numbers. From the left, these
correspond to new cards, learning cards, and cards to review. These are
explained in more detail in the intro videos for the desktop program, so
please http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#_intro_videos[check them out]
if you haven't already.

When you've looked at a card's question and remembered the answer, or decided
you don't know it, tap the *show answer* button. When you do, the bottom area will change to display 2-4 answer buttons,
depending on how you've answered the card previously. The buttons will display
the time a card will next be shown, so 10m means "10 minutes" and "5d" means
"5 days". You can tap directly on these buttons to choose a particular answer. 

To make reviewing faster, you can configure gestures (for example taps and swipes) to answer cards without using the buttons. 
See the <<settings, preferences section>> for more information on configuring gestures.

=== Action Bar
The Action Bar at the top of the study screen has several buttons for performing various common actions. The number of buttons which are shown 
is determined automatically by Android based on the size and resolution of your screen. If there is not enough space to show the button 
for a given action, then the action will be available from the menu instead. If you are unsure what a button does, you can long-tap on it to 
see the name of the action. The following action are available:

Undo :: Undo the answer you chose for the last card you studied (button always shown).
Mark Card :: Adds a "marked" tag to the current note, so it can be easily found in the browser. 
This is useful when you want to take some action on the note at a later date, such as looking up a word when you get home. Marked cards also show a small star in the upper-right-hand corner during reviews.
Edit Card :: Open the edit note screen, where you can change the content displayed on the flashcard (see the <<editingNotes, editing notes section>> for more help)
Hide / Delete :: Give various options for removing the current card or note from your study schedule (see http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#editing-and-more[Anki Desktop manual] for more on these)
Replay Audio :: If the card has audio on the front or back, it will be played again.
Enable / Disable Whiteboard :: This action enables or disables the whiteboard feature for the current deck. The whiteboard feature allows you to draw on the screen, 
which is particularly useful for practicing drawing characters from languages such as Japanese. When the whiteboard has been enabled for the current deck, 
two new actions will become available for clearing and hiding the whiteboard. Disabling the whiteboard will hide these actions as well as the whiteboard itself.

=== Reaching the end of the study session
When you've finished the cards that are due to be studied today, you'll be
shown a congratulations message. If you have other decks, you can return to the decks list 
in the usual way and select a different one. If you've finished studying for the day, you can simply tap the home button in order to
close AnkiDroid (and you can also do this in the middle of reviews if you
wish).

If you wish to keep studying the same cards after the congratulations message
is displayed, please see the <<filtered,filtered deck>> section.

[[addingNotes]]
== Add Note Screen
*_Note:_* _This section onwards assumes you understand what http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#notes-&-fields[notes, fields, card templates, and note types] are_

To add a new note, tap the + button in the action bar at the top of the Deck List, or the Deck Overview screen.
++++++++++
<img src="img/5-adding.png">
++++++++++

The following controls are available in the add note screen:

Type :: Allows you to select the type of note you'd like to add. 
For most purposes the "Basic" note type is sufficient, but for example if you would like an extra card generated which is the reverse of the main card  
(i.e. shows the "Back" field on the front of the card), you could chose the "Basic (and reversed card)" note type.

Deck :: Allows you to change the deck the generated card/cards will be added to.

Fields :: Below the deck selector are the fields for the note (for example the "Basic" note type has two fields "Front" and "Back"). When you tap on a field, 
a keyboard will come up, allowing you to type in information.

Media Buttons :: Next to each field is a media button, which allows you to add media to your note (this feature is currently in the experimental phase).  
Add image lets you add images either via your device's camera (if it has one), or from your photo library. 
Record audio allows you to record your voice and place it into a field. The advanced editor lets you automatically 
search for either translations, pronunciation audio files, or images.

Tags :: Brings up a dialog which lets you add / remove tags from the note.

Cards :: Shows the names of the cards which will be generated for the selected note type. Tapping on this button will bring up a dialog which lets you preview
the source code for the card template of the selected note type. Deleting of cards from a template can be done from directly from AnkiDroid via the menu, 
but all other operations such as adding and editing cards can currently only be done in Anki Desktop. 
See the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#cards-and-templates[cards and templates section] of the Anki Desktop manual for more information about card templates.


When you've finished typing in the content of a note, tap the tick icon in the action bar at the top to add it to
your collection. Alternatively, if you want to go back to what you were doing without saving, you can tap the app icon, or 
use the hardware back button.

There is also an option, accessed from the main menu, to store the entered data for "later" without actually saving a note.
This can be useful for adding data from an external dictionary. There is a corresponding "saved data" item in the menu for 
recalling the data later.

[[editingNotes]]
== Edit Note Screen
The edit note screen can be opened by chosing edit while reviewing, or by opening a card in the browser. 
The edit screen is similar to the add new note screen mentioned above, with some key
differences:


 * Changing the deck operates on the selected card (which is underlined in the "Cards" box). 
 If a note type is chosen which has more than one card, only the currently selected card will be moved to the new deck.
 
 * Changing the "Type" dropdown selector changes to the note type edit mode. In this mode, editing the content of the note (i.e. deck, fields, etc) is disabled, 
 and if a custom note type with more than two fields is being used, additional buttons will appear which let you control the mapping of the fields to the new note type. 
 If a note type is selected which has less cards than the original note type, only the first n cards will be kept. For example changing from "Basic (and reversed card)" to "Basic"
 will lead to only the first card being kept. To warn you of this, the text in the "Cards" box will appear red, and a confirmation dialog will be shown before the note is saved.
 Hint: to change the type for multiple notes in one go, or to customize the mapping between cards, use the "Change note type" option in the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#other-menu-items[browser on Anki Desktop].
 
There are also several advanced options available in the main menu:

Add note :: Create a new empty note
Copy card :: Copy the current note to a new editable note
Reset progress :: Move the card to the end of the new card queue. The current state of the card is cleared, but not its revision history.
Reschedule :: Allows you to reschedule as a review card on a given date. This is useful if you have imported already-learnt material, 
and you want to start it off with higher initial intervals.

[[browser]]
== Finding/Searching/Browsing
You can search for or browse cards by tapping the "Card browser" button from the <<drawer,navigation drawer>>.

++++++++++
<img src="img/6-browser.png">
++++++++++

The browser screen starts by displaying all the cards in the currently selected deck.  You can search for cards in the selected deck 
by tapping the magnifiying glass icon in the top. You can change the selected deck (or change to all decks) by choosing the deck from the
dropdown list on the top left.

The first column shown in the browser is the first field of the note which the card belongs to 
(or the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#fields["sort field"] configured in the desktop version). The second column can be configured 
to show many different parameters by tapping the drop down menu in the column heading. Note that the content of the second column loads
in the background after a search is complete, which can take a long time if you have a lot of cards.

From the search results, you can tap on a card to edit it (see the <<editingNotes,edit note section>> above), or long-tapping on it will show a menu allowing you to 
perform the following actions:

Mark / unmark note :: Add / remove the "marked" tag from the note. Cards with a marked note are highlighted in purple.
Suspend / unsuspend card :: Suspended cards are highlighted in yellow, and are not shown during review.
Delete note :: Delete the note of the currently selected card, and all cards belonging to that note. 
This action cannot be undone without <<backups,restoring from backup>>.
Preview :: Render the currently selected card so that you can see what it looks like in the reviewer.

=== Searching
AnkiDroid supports all the search strings that the desktop version of Anki
does, allowing you to perform quite complex searches. Some examples:

 tag:marked :: show cards that with the tag "marked"
 is:due :: show only cards that are waiting for review
 front:rabbit :: show only cards where the front field is exactly "rabbit" 

For a full list of the possibilities, please see the section in the
http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#searching[desktop manual].

Alternatively, some more commonly used filters (marked, suspended, and tagged cards) can be quickly applied without manually typing them by choosing them from the main menu.

[[filtered]]
== Filtered Decks

Anki is designed to optimize the learning process, so that you study the
minimum amount necessary to remember the majority of your cards. Once the
congratulations screen is reached, further study becomes a case of diminishing
returns: the amount of extra time spent going over the same cards again is
generally not worth the moderate increase in retention you'll see.

That said, if you have a test looming, or simply want to pass some time, it's
possible to keep reviewing once the congratulations screen is reached.

A 'filtered deck' is a temporary deck that contains cards based on various
criteria, such as "forgotten today", "is tagged 'hard'", and so on. After
studying cards in a filtered deck, or when the filtered deck is deleted, the
cards are automatically returned to their original deck.

The easiest way to create a filtered deck is by using the "custom study"
feature in the deck overview screen.

Advanced users can create a filtered deck manually, by choosing "Create filtered deck" from the main menu in the deck list screen.

For further information on filtered decks, please see the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#filtered[desktop documentation].

[[AnkiDesktop]]
== Using Anki Desktop with AnkiDroid
Anki has a free cloud synchronization service called AnkiWeb that makes it
easy to keep your card decks in sync between mobile devices and your computer.
If you cannot use sync for some reason, it's also possible to use USB, though this method is more laborious.

++++++++++
<img src="img/AnkiDesktop.png">
++++++++++

=== Via Cloud Sync
Before you can use AnkiWeb, you'll first need to create an account by visiting https://ankiweb.net and clicking the *Sign Up* button. If you have used
AnkiWeb in the past, you can skip this step. After signing up, see the corresponding instructions below, depending on whether you want to sync from Anki Desktop 
to AnkiDroid, or the other way around.

==== Sync from Computer to AnkiDroid
To copy your existing decks from Anki Desktop to AnkiDroid via AnkiWeb, click the
synchronization button at the top right of the Anki Desktop window - it has two arrows
in a circle. 

If you have never used AnkiWeb before you will need to enter your credentials if prompted, and 
then press the "Upload to AnkiWeb" button to confirm overwriting the empty collection on AnkiWeb with the collection 
on Anki Desktop. Anki will upload all your cards, images and audio to AnkiWeb. If
you have a lot of media, this may take some time.

Once the synchronization has completed, return to your mobile device, and tap the
*Sync* button in the action bar at the top of the main <<deckPicker, deck list>>. 
After entering your AnkiWeb credentials, AnkiDroid will download all your cards and media, 
and remember your login information for next time.

Note that if you have any existing material in AnkiDroid before attempting to sync, you may be shown a message 
asking you to choose to either download from AnkiWeb, or upload to AnkiWeb. If you are happy to lose the cards 
in AnkiDroid then simply choose *Download*. If you need to merge the existing cards with AnkiDroid then see the 
<<AnkiWebConflicts, resolving conflicts>> section.

After the first synchronization has completed, you can click the sync button
again any time you wish to synchronize your changes to the cloud. Only changes
made since the previous sync will be sent, so subsequent syncs are a lot
faster.

If you add some new cards on the desktop computer and want to sync them to
AnkiDroid, you'd repeat the same basic process: sync on desktop (or close the
program, as it syncs automatically on close by default), and then tap the sync
button on AnkiDroid.

==== Sync from AnkiDroid to Computer
The process of syncing from AnkiDroid to computer is essentially the same as syncing from computer to 
AnkiDroid, but in reverse.

From the <<deckPicker, deck list>>, tap the sync button in the top right (it has two arrows
in a circle). If it's your first time using AnkiWeb, you may need to 
enter your login credentials, and then press the "upload" button to upload your AnkiDroid collection 
to AnkiWeb.

Once the synchronization has completed, open Anki Desktop on your computer and press the sync button there 
(with two arrows in a circle), and Anki will download your collection.

[[AnkiWebConflicts]]
==== Dealing with merge conflicts on AnkiWeb
Although it should not happen often, occasionally you may end up in the position where your cards on AnkiDroid can 
not be automatically merged with the cards on AnkiWeb. In this case it's necessary to choose to either upload to or download from
AnkiWeb, which would overwrite any changes on the other side. 

If you have new cards on both sides which you want to keep, 
before syncing you can <<exporting,export a deck package>> for each deck containing new cards from AnkiDroid, then when you do the sync 
choose "download" to download from AnkiWeb. After the synchronization has completed, you can import the decks you previously exported from AnkiDroid, 
as per the <<importing, importing section>>.

=== Via USB

If you don't have regular internet access, it's still possible to copy decks
back and forth to your device, by using USB.

The USB method works by importing or exporting all your decks at once. 
This means that unlike syncing via AnkiWeb, you can't make changes from
two locations at once and then merge them. Instead, if you wish to add cards
on the desktop, you need to make sure you export the latest version of your
collection from your mobile device first, or you'll end up losing any reviews
done on the mobile device.

Thus the workflow you would typically use is to export your collection from
your mobile device and import it into the desktop, make modifications on the
desktop, and then export your collection and import it back into your mobile
device.

AnkiDroid can't directly import text files. If you wish to do that, you'll
need to do that with the desktop program, and then import your collection into
AnkiDroid.

==== Copy all decks from Anki Desktop to AnkiDroid via USB

On your computer:

 . Open the desktop program.
 . Choose File>Export from the menu.

 . Click the 'Export...' button. Make sure to leave "all decks" selected, as
 it's not possible to import individual decks into AnkiDroid. "Include
 scheduling information" must also remain checked.
 . Anki will automatically create a collection.apkg on your desktop. If the
   file is named something else, please see the previous step again.
 . Connect your Android device to your computer via the USB cable.
 . Open the file explorer on your computer and view the contents of your Android device.
 . Locate the AnkiDroid folder.
 . Drag the collection.apkg file from your desktop into this AnkiDroid folder.
 
Then in AnkiDroid:

 . From the main decks screen, tap "Import file" from the menu
 . Tap on "Collection" and then confirm

Once complete, the decks on your device will have been replaced with the decks from your desktop. See the section on 
<<importing, importing apkg files>> for more help with importing.

==== Copy all decks from AnkiDroid to Anki Desktop via USB

The process to copy your decks from AnkiDroid to Anki Desktop is essentially the same as above, but in reverse.

 . Start with your device disconnected from USB
 . Choose "Export" from the main menu in the Deck Screen
 . Ensure "Include scheduling information" remains checked and press *OK*
 . Connect device to computer using USB
 . Copy the "collection.apkg" from the path specified in the message to the desktop on your computer
 . Double click on the file to import into Anki Desktop
 
See the <<exporting, exporting section>> below for more detailed information on exporting from Anki Droid.

[[importing]]
== Importing Anki Files
You can import Anki files (with .apkg file format) directly into AnkiDroid. Other file formats cannot be imported directly into AnkiDroid, however 
flashcards from most other applictions can be imported into Anki Desktop on your computer, which can then be <<adding,added into AnkiDroid in the usual way>>. 
See the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#importing[importing section of the Anki Desktop manual] for help on importing into Anki Desktop.

As in Anki Desktop, AnkiDroid distinguishes between http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#exporting-packaged-decks[the two types of .apkg files] 
("collection package" and "deck package") based on the filename.  Collection packages have the name "collection.apkg", and when imported will 
completely _replace all contents_ in AnkiDroid. Any apkg file which is _*not*_ named "collection.apkg" will be treated as a deck package, 
which will be _merged with any existing content_ when imported into to AnkiDroid.

You can import .apkg Anki collection files into AnkiDroid either by opening them using the standard Android system, or by manually 
importing them from within AnkiDroid:

=== Open the file using Android
Apkg files are automatically associated with AnkiDroid, so for example if you open a .apkg email attachment which you sent to yourself, then 
AnkiDroid will automatically open the file and confirm if you want to import it. Simply click OK and the apkg file will be imported.

=== Import the file manually in AnkiDroid
You can also manually import .apkg files as follows:

 * Connect your device to your computer using USB
 * Copy the .apkg from your computer to the AnkiDroid folder on your device
 * Open AnkiDroid on your device
 * From the main menu in the deck list, choose *Import*
 * Choose the apkg file you just copied to your device when prompted
 * Tap OK
 
[[exporting]]
== Exporting Anki Files
AnkiDroid can export your flashcards in the .apkg Anki file format so that you can import them into Anki Desktop, or share them with other people. 
As in Anki Desktop, you can either export a http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#exporting-packaged-decks[collection package or deck package], depending 
on what you are trying to acheive.

There are two export options available: "include scheduling information" and "include media". Generally the default options are sufficient, 
if you choose not to include scheduling information, Anki will assume that you are sharing the deck with other people, 
and will remove marked and leech tags so that they will have a clean copy of it.

=== Exporting collection package
When exporting for use in Anki Desktop, you generally want to export your entire collection, including all your review history etc. 

From the main menu in the decks screen:

 . Tap the *Export* item in the menu.
 . Tap *OK* using default options
 . Tap *OK* again to email the exported collection.apkg file to yourself, or alternatively you can manually copy to your computer using USB
 
To import the file on your computer:

 . Save the file "collection.apkg" to your desktop
 . Double-click on the file to start Anki.
 . Confirm you wish to replace, so that the deck from your mobile device
   overwrites the old data on your desktop.
 . After importing, you can delete the apkg file on your desktop if you wish.
 
=== Exporting deck package
If you want to share a deck in AnkiDroid with another user, you can export a deck package. 

From the main menu in the decks screen:

 . Long tap on the deck you wish to export
 . Tap *Export*
 . Tap *OK* using the default options
 . Tap *OK* again to email the exported apkg to another user
 

[[backups]]
== Automatic Backups

AnkiDroid will automatically create backups of your collection for you. The backups include all your cards and statistics, but do not include
sounds or images.

The backup is taken in the background when you first start the app. A backup will only happen if more than 5 hours has elapsed since the last time a backup was created. 
By default, AnkiDroid will store the last 8 backups; this number can be changed in the main settings.

You can restore a backup by choosing the *restore from backup* option from the main menu of the <<deckPicker,decks screen>>.

[[settings]]
== Preferences

The preferences screen can be accessed by opening the navigation drawer, and choosing "Settings".
 It allows you to customize various application settings and how AnkiDroid appears.

The Preferences screen is divided up into different sections, which are
covered below.

=== AnkiDroid
These are the general settings which affect the whole app:

Collection path:: Change the location where AnkiDroid's data is stored

AnkiWeb account:: Change the account used for syncing with the cloud. For more information on syncing, please see <<AnkiDesktop,this
section>>.

Fetch media on sync:: By default, AnkiDroid will sync sounds and images as well as your cards and review history. 
 If you disable this option, sounds and images will not be synced by AnkiDroid.
 
Deck for new cards:: The default of "When adding, default to current deck" means that Anki saves the last-used note type for each deck 
and selects it again then next time you choose the deck (and, in addition, will start with the current deck selected when choosing 
Add from anywhere). The other option, "Change deck depending on note type," saves the last-used deck for each note type 
(and opens the add window to the last-used note type when you choose Add). This may be more convenient if you always use a single note 
type for each deck.

Language:: Change the language. Note: AnkiDroid translations are contributed by volunteers. If you find missing or incorrect translations, 
feel free to contribute to the translation project. More details can be found on the https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/wiki/Contribution#Translate_AnkiDroid_into_your_language[AnkiDroid Wiki].

Error reporting mode:: Control whether or not AnkiDroid asks your permission before sending error reports to our error reporting system
when AnkiDroid crashes. You can also disable the reporting feature entirely if you wish.

==== Notifications
This subsection allows you configure when and how AnkiDroid shows alerts in the Android notification bar.

Notify when :: Disable all notifications, only show important status updates, or set a threshold where a notifcation is shown when you have more than n cards due.

Vibrate:: Checking this will make your device vibrate when showing a notification

Blink light::  Checking this will make your device light blink when an unread notification exists (if your device has a notification LED)


=== Reviewing

The reviewing screen allows you to customize how AnkiDroid behaves when you're
reviewing cards. Note that only the reviewing settings which are applied to *all decks* are shown here. There are more settings related 
to reviewing which are *deck specific*. These deck specific settings are located in *Deck options*.

New card position :: Controls when new cards are shown: either mixed with, after, or before all reviews.

Start of next day :: Controls when AnkiDroid should start showing the next day’s cards. 
The default setting of 4AM ensures that if you’re studying around midnight, you won’t have two days' worth of cards shown to you in one 
session. If you stay up very late or wake up very early, you may want to adjust this to a time you’re usually sleeping.

Learn ahead limit :: The Learn ahead limit tells AnkiDroid how to behave when there is nothing left to study in the current deck 
but cards in learning. The default setting of 20 minutes tells AnkiDroid that cards should be shown early if they are due to be shown in 
less than 20 minutes and there’s nothing else to do. If you set this to 0, Anki will always wait the full period, showing the congratulations 
screen until the remaining cards are ready to be reviewed.

Timebox limit:: Timeboxing is a technique to help you focus by dividing a longer activity (such as a 30 minute study session) into smaller 
blocks. If you set the timebox time limit to a non-zero number of minutes, AnkiDroid will periodically show a message saying you how many 
cards you’ve managed to study during the prescribed time limit.

Disable typing answer :: If you have set up your cards to ask you to type in the
answer (as explained in http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#templates[this
section] of the desktop manual), AnkiDroid will display a keyboard on such
cards and allow you to check your answer. If you find typing on a mobile
device inconvenient, you can use this option to disable the keyboard for all
cards.

==== Display
This subsection relates to the way cards are displayed during reviewing

Keep screen on :: Ignore the automatic screen timeout setting in Android to always keep the screen on.

Fullscren mode :: Hide the Android notification bar so that you can use more of the screen

Center align ::  By default AnkiDroid tries to show cards exactly as they are shown on Anki Desktop, however if you prefer your cards 
to be center aligned vertically in AnkiDroid then you can enable this feature.

Show button time :: By default, the answer buttons will display the time a card will
next be shown. If you disable this option, the times will not appear, and only labels like "Again", "Good" and
"Easy" will be shown.

Answer button size :: If you find it difficult to press the answer button, you can use this setting to make it bigger.

Show remaining :: Disabling this allows you to hide the card count in the top left of the screen, which will allow you to use more of the screen.

==== Whiteboard
This subsection controls the whiteboard in the reviewer.
Note: the whiteboard must be enabled in each deck individually from the menu in the study screen.

Stroke width :: Control the stroke width of the whiteboard. Reducing the stroke width may allow you to draw with more detail.

Black strokes :: Use black strokes instead of color, which may reduce memory usage. Note: this setting doesn't apply when night mode is enabled.

==== Automatic display answer
The automatic display answer feature allows you to have the answer shown automatically after some timeout period. You can also have the next 
question shown automatically; in this case the card is assumed to be failed (i.e. the again button is automatically chosen)

Time to show answer :: Time to wait until answer is automatically shown

Time to show next question :: Time to wait until next question is automatically shown.

=== Fonts
In this screen you can change the font used by AnkiDroid, and some scaling options related to fonts. 
See the <<customFonts, custom fonts>> section for more information about using custom fonts.

Default font :: Choose the default font used by the AnkiDroid reviewer. You can add fonts to this list by copying them to the "fonts" folder.

Default font applicability :: The default setting is to only use the default font when no font has been specified in the card styling 
via Anki Desktop, however you can also force the default font to be applied, ignoring any font specification in the card styling.

Browser and editor font :: The font to be used by the browser and editor

Reviewer font scaling :: Allows you to increase or decrease the size of the text on cards without modifying how they appear on a computer. 
It is not specific to a deck - when changed, it changes all cards in all decks in the same way.

Reviewer image scaling :: This feature may be useful if you want images to also be scaled in the same proportion as the font

Card browser font scaling :: Lets you change the font size used in the card browser.

[[gestures]]
=== Gestures
AnkiDroid allows you to customize the interface, so that actions you perform
frequently can be accomplished quickly by using tap and swipe gestures.

==== Actions
The following gestures can be used:

 * Swipe up
 * Swipe down
 * Swipe left
 * Swipe right
 * Double touch
 * Touch top
 * Touch bottom
 * Touch left
 * Tough right
 * Long press

The following actions are available for each gesture:

No action :: Don't do anything. Useful if you want to disable certain swipes, tap
zones and so on.

Answer button 1 :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the red
button, indicating you wish to review the card again soon. This is useful when
you forgot a card or wish to review it more frequently. 
When the question is shown, this action (and all other answer actions below) will simply show the answer.

Answer button 2 :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the second button from the left, 
generally indicating you found the card hard to remember.

Answer button 3 :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the third button from the left.

Answer button 4 :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the fourth button from the left (when applicable).

Answer recommended (green) :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the green button.
This is the button you should end up using the most.

Answer better than recommended :: When the answer screen is shown, choose the button on the
right, indicating you found the card too easy to remember and would like a
much longer delay.

Undo :: Undoes the last action.

Edit card :: Edits the current card.

Mark :: Adds a tag called "Marked" the current note, so it can be easily found
in a search.

Lookup expression :: When the lookup feature is enabled (in advanced settings), lookup an expression
in the selected dictionary. Note: the expression needs to be copied to the clipboard before this action will work.

Bury card :: Hides the current card from review. When you return to the deck list,
it will be added back for review.

Suspend Card :: Prevent current card from being shown during review until you
unsuspend it via the card browser.

Delete Card :: Deletes the currently shown note and all of its cards. If
you're not studying in multiple directions, this will just delete a single
card.

Play media :: Replay any audio on the card

Abort learning :: Stop reviewing and go back to the deck overview page

=== Advanced
Some less common features for advanced users are shown here

Force full sync ::
Tap this item to force a full upload or download on the next sync (for example, because you accidentally deleted a deck on one side and want to restore the deck rather than having its deletion synchronized).

Safe Display Mode ::
The safe display mode setting may be useful for users of e-ink devices such as Nooks who experience problems with content display, as well as for some users of older devices where custom fonts cause an `OutOfMemory` error. When enabled the setting does the following:

  * Disable scrollbar fading
  * Use safer (but slower) method of rendering flashcards, where the underlying `Webview` is recreated for each flashcard.

See https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=762[issue 762], https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=1253[issue 1253], and https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=687[issue 687] for more details.

Simple Interface ::
Displays the card content in a simple `ScrollTextView` instead of the usual `WebView`. Consequently, cards are displayed much faster, but only simple text information can be rendered. This feature is a bit buggy.

Tags to Exclude ::
A comma separated list of content to exclude when using the simple interface, in order to avoid seeing the html code for content which can't be rendered.

Disable Backups ::
Disable the automatic creation of backups. Not recommended.

Input Workaround ::
Some older devices couldn't gain focus into the text input box for typed-answer fields, so this was added (Hidden for API > 14).

Longclick Workaround ::
Some older devices couldn't detect longclick for initiating selecting/copying of text, so this was added (Hidden for API > 10).
 
Fix for Hebrew Vowels ::
Some older devices couldn't render Hebrew text, so this feature was added which allows the user to download and install a Hebrew font which is known to work.

Improve Arabic Display ::
This is a workaround to allow displaying of Arabic even on Android 2.2 (Hidden for API > 8).

Text to Speech ::
Enable this option to have Android read out all the text on your flashcards using the default text to speech engine. Google's built-in TTS engine should work; 3rd party TTS engines may or may not.
AnkiDroid will ask you to select the language for the front and back of your cards once for each deck on the first time you review a card in that deck. 
To change the language or disable TTS for a given deck after making your initial choice, you'll need to use the "reset languages" option described below and reconfigure for each deck.

_This feature may be removed in the future in favor of a separately downloadable plugin_

Lookup Dictionary ::
Dictionary to use to lookup words copied to the clipboard in the reviewer. After setting up a dictionary, do the following to perform the lookup:

 * Longclick on the text you want to copy in the reviewer
 * After selecting the word you want to copy, press the "copy" icon in the action bar at the top of the screen
 * Tap once anywhere on the flashcard
 * A magnifying class icon should appear, which performs the lookup when clicked

Alternatively, the lookup action can be performed via a gesture.

_This feature will likely be removed in the future in favor of a plugin_

Reset Languages ::
Useful for resetting the TTS language

eReader (up/down buttons) ::
Support for eReader hardware buttons (see https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=722[issue 722])

_This feature will likely be removed in the future in favor of a plugin_

eReader Double Scrolling ::
Double the scrolling distance when using the eReader hardware buttons


== Advanced Features
[[reverseCards]]
=== Reverse Cards
The Anki system has http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#note-types[built-in note types which allow you to review cards in both directions]. 
When <<addingNotes, creating new material>> in AnkiDroid, you should choose one of these note types, such as "Basic (and reversed card)", 
which will automatically generate a reverse card for you.

If you used the wrong note type when adding your material, you can change the note type for multiple cards at once using the browser in Anki Desktop. 
To do this, follow the instructions in the <<AnkiDesktop,syncing with Anki Desktop section>>, then in Anki Desktop open the browser, 
select the cards you want to change, then choose *Change note type* from the menu.

Alternatively, if your cards are using a custom note type which doesn't include a reverse card, you can add a reverse card to that note type 
by following the instructions in the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#reverse-cards[reverse cards section] of the Anki Desktop user manual.

[[customFonts]]
=== Custom Fonts

AnkiDroid allows you to use non-system fonts on your cards. To set them up properly,
it is strongly recommended to use Anki Desktop. Please see
http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#installingfonts[the corresponding section in the desktop
manual] for more information.

Alternatively, you can create a new subfolder "fonts" in the main AnkiDroid directory (i.e. the folder specified under 
Settings > AnkiDroid > Collection path), copy a compatible ttf font file there, 
and then set this as the default font under Settings > Fonts > Default font. 
Note: using this method is much less reliable than the recommended way, and will likely lead to inconsistencies if you study on more than one device.

Only fonts in the ttf format are officially supported in Anki/AnkiDroid; 
the https://www.google.com/get/noto/#/[Google Noto] font set is highly recommended for all languages, 
and some other free fonts can be found https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/wiki/FreelyDistributableFonts[here].

Please note that AnkiDroid has to load the entire font into memory in order
to use it, and fonts for Asian languages can be quite large. If you have an
older device and notice AnkiDroid crashing frequently after installing a
font, you may have exceeded your device's memory limits.

*Note 1*: If you have "Fetch media on sync" disabled, you may need to manually copy the font file from Anki Desktop to your AnkiDroid/collection.media folder.

*Note 2*: Some fonts may have the extension .ttf, but are in fact in a different format such as .ttc, which has been found to not work on some devices. 
We recommend only using official open source fonts, such as Google Noto. Post to the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anki-android[support forum] if you need specific font help.

*Note 3*: Custom fonts generally don't work on Android 2.1 (Eclair). This is a limitation of the Android framework and not a problem with AnkiDroid.

[[customizingCardLayout]]
=== Custom Card Layout
The layout of flashcards is completely customizable, although it is currently necessary to do the customization using <<AnkiDesktop, Anki Desktop>>.
The http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#cards-and-templates[card templates section] of the Anki Desktop manual has detailed instructions on how to do this.

[[typeInAnswer]]
=== Type in the answer feature

AnkiDroid allows you to type in the correct answer and then compare it to the right answer. You have to set this up with Anki desktop, 
as described in the http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#checking-your-answer[Anki Desktop manual].

Anki desktop replaces the “{{type:NN}}” field on
the front of a card with an input box in the card. On AnkiDroid it is replaced with a “......” prompt instead, and a text
input box is shown at the bottom. The comparison between typed text and
the correct text is shown on the answer side in place of the
“{{type:NN}}” field there, like on Anki desktop.

The text input box and the soft keyboard can be hidden by ticking
“Disable typing in answer” in the preferences.

Even with typing disabled, the correct answer is shown on the answer
side. This is done on purpose; otherwise the correct answer might not
be shown at all.

To hide the comparison (e.g. because the correct answer is shown anyway), the HTML id
“typeans” can be used. Add “.mobile #typeans {display: none;}” to the
http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#cards-and-templates[card styling] using Anki Desktop.

The type answer prompt and the comparison have more classes that
can be used to change the way they are displayed. Some of these are
the same as on Anki Desktop, some are specific to AnkiDroid.

The comparison uses three classes, typeGood, typeBad and typeMissing
to add green, red and gray background to the typing comparison. These
three classes are used on Anki desktop as well.

The “......” prompt has the class “typePrompt”.

When typing is set to off in the preferences, the class “typeOff” is
added to the prompt on the question side, and to the div element
containing the comparison on the answer side. This class can be used
to show the type prompt or to hide the typing comparison in
this case.
